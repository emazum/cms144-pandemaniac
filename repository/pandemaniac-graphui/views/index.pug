    :markdown-it
      1. **Login / Logout**

         Register your team via Piazza per the instructions. Logins
         may be done by visiting [here](/login), and you may log out by
         visiting [here](/logout).

      2. **List of Graphs Available for Submission**

         You can see a list of available graphs [here](/submit).
         Please remember to submit before **11:55pm**.

         During the practice rounds, feel free to submit for as many of
         the available graphs as you want, keeping in mind it is in your
         best interest to get as much practice in order to optimize your
         strategy.

         Each link on the dashboard will take you to a page where you
         can download a graph, and then upload your choice of seed
         nodes. Once the download _finishes_ (so you won't be penalized
         for a slow connection), a timer will start. You can monitor the
         status of how much time remains by refreshing the page. No more
         attempts can be made once the timer has expired, but any number
         of attempts can be made beforehand.

      3. **Submission Results**

         The results of all submissions can be viewed [here](/graph),
         and new ones will be made available the following day by
         10:00am.

         Each link on the dashboard will take you to a page where you
         can view an animation of the epidemic on the graph.

         Strategies of all teams' submissions can be downloaded
         [here](/graph/download)
